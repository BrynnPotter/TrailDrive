# TrailDrive

In conservation in Africa and around the world, Trail cameras are a huge help in conservation efforts,  my idea is to find a way to piggyback a wardriving software onto a camera and then being able to use trail cameras to detect any wifi networks being brought into the area, this can help monitor human movement in wildlife areas.

## Description
TrailDrive integrates trail camera capabilities with wardriving to send email notifications when new Wi-Fi devices are detected.
